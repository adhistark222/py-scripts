# py-scripts
My experimentations on python scripts.

My list of projects in this repo include:
- ## Medgraph Insight [here](./schema-gen/MedGraph%20Insight/README.md)
    * #### Project Title: Synthetic Data Generation for Patient Demographics and Stats [here](./schema-gen/MedGraph%20Insight/README.md)
    * This Python script generates synthetic medical datasets, incorporating patient demographics, co-morbidity, mortality rates, and yearly statistics for a specific medical condition. It serves as a valuable tool for creating realistic yet privacy-compliant datasets, facilitating testing and development in medical research and analytics.

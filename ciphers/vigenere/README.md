# py-scripts/ciphers/vigenere
# Project Title: Vigenere Cipher

## Introduction

This Python script implements the Vigenère cipher, a classical encryption technique. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a provided key, providing a simple yet effective method for securing messages.

## Purpose

The purpose of this script is to demonstrate the functionality of the Vigenère cipher and its application in text encryption and decryption. By accepting user input for the text and key, it enables users to encode and decode messages securely, offering a hands-on experience with cryptographic techniques.

## Environment

- Python Version: 3.11
- IDE: Spyder 5.4.3

## Dependencies
No external dependencies are required to run this script. It is written in pure Python and can be executed using any Python interpreter.

## Usage

1. **Input:**
   - Users are prompted to input the text they want to encrypt or decrypt, as well as the key for the Vigenère cipher.

2. **Encryption:**
   - The script encrypts the input text using the provided key and displays the encrypted message.

3. **Decryption:**
   - Users can also decrypt an encrypted message by providing the encrypted text along with the same key used for encryption. The script then decrypts the message and displays the original plaintext.

## Output Example

```console
Enter your text:python is awesome
Enter the key:happy coding

Encrypted text: wyiwmp wv ijkzobt
Key: happycoding

Decrypted text: python is awesome

Is decrypted text same as entered text: True
```
